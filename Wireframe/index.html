          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing 
            changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software 
            teams manage changes to source code over time. By far, the most widely used modern 
            version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained 
            open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of 
            the Linux operating system kernel.</p>

          <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
          <p>Git is all about efficiency. For developers, it eliminates everything from the time 
            wasted passing commits over a network connection to the man hours required to integrate 
            changes in a centralized version control system. It even makes better use of junior 
            developers by giving them a safe environment to work in. All of this affects the bottom 
            line of your engineering department.</p>

          <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
          <p>Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to 
            add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to 
            encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the 
            main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before 
            merging it into the main branch.</p>
